# Human navigation strategies, their errors and variability result from dynamic interactions of spatial uncertainties
The repository contains the model code, simulated data and analysis code for the manuscript: "Human navigation strategies, their errors and variability result from dynamic interactions of spatial uncertainties".

## Model Code
The folder *model* contains relevant code for running the computational model both locally (via Jupyter Notebook) and compute clusters via the corresponding SLURM scripts contained in the *simulation scripts* folder. 

## Analysis Code
The folder analysis contains relevant code for recreating key plots from the paper based on simulated data.
