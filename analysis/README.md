# Probabilistic Navigation Data Analysis
This repository contains the simulated model data for our manuscript "Human navigation strategies, their errors and variability result from dynamic interactions of spatial uncertainties". The accompanying notebook analyses the simulated data according to the procedures of the original studies and generates relevant figures shown in the manuscript. 

# System Requirements
The analysis with Python 3.9.9 under macOS 12.2.1 (M1 Pro). For package requirements and software dependencies please refer to the requirements.txt. 

# Installation Guide
To setup the package please run the 'setup-env.sh'. This will first create a virtual environment and then install all necessary dependencies. 

# Demo
The full data analysis and plot generation procedures can be found under: "notebooks/Analysis Simulated Model Data.ipynb". 

# Instruction Use 
Relevant files for analysis can be found within the 'analysis' folder. Reproduction of relevant figures (model data only) can be achieved by executing all cells in the accomanying notebook.
