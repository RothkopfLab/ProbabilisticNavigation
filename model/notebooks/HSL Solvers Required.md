Important note:
The use of solvers such as 'MA57' requires additional libhsl and libcoin files, which can be obtained via http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk and need to be installed accordingly. Without these additional libraries the code will not execute properly (i.e. the model gets stuck and nothing will happen in each iteration). Instructions on how to install CasADI + IPOPT + HSL can be found here: https://github.com/ami-iit/ami-commons/blob/master/doc/casadi-ipopt-hsl.md

You can also directly paste the following three solver libraries right here:
libcoinhsl.dylib
libhsl.dylib
